## ROS-Robot-description-pkg
This ROS package provides the Unified Robot Description Format (URDF) and Xacro files to model a 7-DOF (Degrees of Freedom) robotic arm mounted on a differential wheeled robot. The package is designed to be compatible with ROS-based simulation environments like Gazebo and Rviz, allowing users to visualize, simulate, and control the robot.
