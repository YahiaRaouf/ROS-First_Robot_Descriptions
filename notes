The transmission tag relates a joint to an actuator. It defines the type of transmission that
we are using in a particular joint, as well as the type of motor and its parameters. It also
defines the type of hardware interface we use when we interface with the ROS controllers.

1.1 transmission attributes
	name(required)
		specifies the unique name of transmission

1.2 trnasmission elements
	<type>(once)
		specifies trans. type.
	
	<joint>(more thena once)
		the joint which the transmission is connected to. specified by its name attribute. and the following sub-elements:
		
		<hardwareInterface>(more than one occurence)
			specifies a supported joint-space hardware interface.Note that the value of this tag should be EffortJointInterface when this transmission is loaded in Gazebo and hardware_interface/EffortJointInterface when this transmission is loaded in RobotHW.
		
		Note: Hardware Interfaces are used by ROS control in conjunction with one of the ROS controllers to send and receive commands to hardware.
